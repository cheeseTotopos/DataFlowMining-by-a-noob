What does r2 = 0.0683 means?

First, review the program. Were trying to predict the average salary. As you probably already guess,
to predict results we need data. 

The data we used to predict, are the variables Type of job and average experience.

The small result means that using both of the previous variables, we can predict the average salary with 
a precission of 6.8%. Thats not accurate at all.

The tiny result could mean we need more variables to predict the average data, but we do not dispose
more information. Also, could mean that our way to clasify the jobs areas by a string (the type of job dataset column)
its not accurate at all
