The x axis represents the years experience, an the y axis represents the average salary, so in the graph
we have the average salary depending of the experience.

The red line has a positive slope, that suggest a relation between the experience and the salary.
The blue dots represents the jobs and its average salary.

So, we are watching high vertical variability between the blue slots, that means that the average salary varies
on jobs with low experience needed. In other words, according to our dataset, in jobs with low experience needed, the salary could be
or pretty good, or not good enough.
Also we can say that the salary variation between jobs is lower when the experience needed increases.

Other thing that que should notice, is that regardless low or high experience, the average salary for jobs (blue dots) is 
pretty high, so we can conclude that, yes, the experience could predict in some extent, the job salary, but no with whole accuracy.

Thinking out of the result, this is obvious, because we cannot conclude or expect that an job average salary only depends of the
experience needed, of course the experience could be a fact that determines the experience, but not the only fact, like the job area,
the location, the company, the economy situation of the location, etc.
